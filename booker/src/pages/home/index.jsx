        <p><strong>How does Booker work?</strong></p>
        <p>Booker is a <a href="http://reactjs.org">React app</a> that uses the <a href="https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/reference/volumes/list">Google Books API</a> to retrieve and display book information.</p>
        <p><strong>Do you make money off of Booker?</strong></p>
        <p>Nope! There are no affiliate links or any other revenue streams within Booker.</p>
        <p><strong>What's with the name? It sounds like "booger".</strong></p>
        <p>This is a sample app that doesn't need a fancy name. Also, you're gross.</p>

          <p><strong>Did you intend for this text to become pyramid-shaped?</strong></p>
